# Testing All Blog Components

This post demonstrates all the custom components we've created for the blog.

## Table of Contents

<TableOfContents />

## Code Block

Here's a syntax-highlighted code block:

```typescript
// A simple function in TypeScript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const user = "Reader";
console.log(greet(user));
```

## Blockquote

Here's a blockquote with attribution:

<Blockquote
  author="Albert Einstein"
  citation="Address to the Physical Society, Berlin, 1918"
>
  The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source
  of all true art and science.
</Blockquote>

And a regular markdown blockquote:

> This is a regular markdown blockquote
> that should also use our styling

## Callouts

<Callout type="info" title="Information">
  This is an informational callout. Use it for providing additional context or
  details.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
  This is a warning callout. Use it to alert readers about potential issues or
  things to consider.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Error">
  This is an error callout. Use it to highlight critical issues or problems.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Tip">

  practices.
</Callout>
