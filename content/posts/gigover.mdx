title: Gigover landing page

Last month I finished rebuilding the{" "}

<a href="https://gigover.com/">Gigover</a> landing page.

Like with most projects there comes a time when it needs to be updated.
I have worked as a free-lance developer for Gigover for a year and and a half
and most spent most time on the system, so now it was time to give the ladning
page some well-deserved love.

I got the design from a designer in a figma file and got to work.
The old page was written in Next.js and used styled components. The first step
was to update packages and versions.

I wanted to update the project and use Chakra-UI, since the system is using
that ui library. And I think it's good to have it be the same in both
projects.

My first instinct was to rewrite it from scratch. It's wasy, it's fun, and who
doesn't like starting a new shiny project. No old code, no need to refactor,
no need to updated packages, APIs or anything!

This is still a double-edged sword. The old webpage had been in produciton
since mid 2021 and to my best knowledge never had any problems.

The old version of the homepage used{" "}

<a href="https://styled-components.com/">styled component</a> but most of the
system it self uses <a href="https://v2.chakra-ui.com/">Chakra-UI</a>I wanted to
make the styling consistent between projects. It's easier and quicker to jump
between projects when it uses the same technique.

One drawback is that Chakra-UI doesn't wokr well with Next.js
Chakra does not work with server components so instead of using Next.js only
with client component I decied to use{" "}

<a href="https://vitejs.dev/">vite</a> and react.

Since vite + react don't have built in routing like the app router in Next.js
I had to add in some routing capability.
I wanted to test{" "}

<a href="https://tanstack.com/router/latest">tanstack-router</a>
but refrained against it after some thought. I wanted something well known, easy
to use, and something that had been around and will be around. I chose
<a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview">react-router</a>
and created a simple easy to use router.

I had do some extra steps to make the react vite project performed similar for
SEO. Since a big reason for why I wanted to use Nextjs was improved SEO
I added{" "}

<a href="https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap">react-snap</a>
to pre-render the SPA and help with SEO. The new webpage looks well with the new
design.

It's harder to read code than write it. So it was easier to start a new
project rather than updating a project that has not been updated in two
years."

I advise you to think twice before you decide to start a new project from
scratch. At least take things into consideration
