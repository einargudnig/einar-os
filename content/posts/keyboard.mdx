<Heading>Keychron q8 pro</Heading>
<br />

I want to post more, so now I'm going to one shot a post about my
keyboard.

<br />
No editing, little to no proofreading and hopefully no typos.
<br />
There is something about writing on a mechanical keyboard. The feel, the sound,
all of it is so satisfying.
<br />
Now I have Keychorn Q8 Pro that I use at home. I've made some updates to it.

I added an acoustic foam kit, which consists of three piecse of foam that you
put inside the case. The foam is made of Poron and XPE material.

All these foams help to reduce the echo.

I've made some minor configrations to this keyboard, so the right side space
bar is enter, the right side fn2 is backspace. This allowes me to use the
keyboard without needing to reach the pinky finger all the way to the top
right.

I have also created a rules with karabiner that supercharge any keyboard, I'll
leave that for a later post. All of the kudos goes to Max Stoiber.

<Subheading>Wine üçá</Subheading>

While writing this review I had one glass of red wine, a 2020 La grola.

<br />
It was a good wine, from Northern Italy, I haven't tasted many wines with the
Corvina grapes, so this was a nice surprise.
