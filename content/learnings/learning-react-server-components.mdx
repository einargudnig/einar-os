# Server Components mental model

I revisited how React Server Components render on the server and stream to the client.

- They can fetch data without using client bundles
- They compose with Client Components at boundaries
- They reduce JS shipped to the browser

```tsx
export async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://example.com/api");
  return res.json();
}
```

RSC shine when most of your UI can be rendered on the server.
